# SecuritySystem

This is a basic security system by which you can add/delete passwords to enter/exit a system.
Keep in mind this is one of my first coding projects in C (I wrote it in Fall 2014),and I did not have any experience in OOP.  
But it works functionally, so enjoy!  
To run:  
$ make  
$ ./pass  

The root password is "PASS"
