# SecuritySystem

This is a basic security system by which you can add/delete passwords to enter/exit a system.
Keep in mind that I made this 3 months after I learned how to program in C (Fall 2014), I had not had any experience in OOP.
But it works functionally, so enjoy!
To run:
$ make
$ ./pass

The root password is "PASS"
